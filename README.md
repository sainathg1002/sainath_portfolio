### Header Section



The header is the first thing a user sees and acts as the site's primary navigation. It's a crucial component for user experience.



- **Purpose:** To provide site-wide navigation and brand identity.

- **Elements:**

  - **Logo/Name:** My name or a simple logo that serves as the brand identity and, when clicked, returns the user to the `Home` section.

  - **Navigation Links:** A set of links (`Home`, `About`, `Projects`, `Skills`, `Contact`) that allow users to jump to different sections of the website.

  - **Hamburger Menu (Mobile):** On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu icon. Clicking this icon toggles the visibility of the navigation menu, saving screen space and improving usability.



- **Implementation Details:**

  - The header is styled to be `position: fixed` or `position: sticky` to remain visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This ensures that navigation is always accessible.

  - CSS Flexbox or Grid is used to align the logo and navigation links horizontally.

  - A media query is used to hide the traditional navigation links and display the hamburger menu icon below a certain screen width (e.g., `max-width: 768px`).

### Home Section



The home section is the main landing page and serves as a digital introduction to who I am.



- **Purpose:** To capture the user's attention, introduce myself, and provide a clear call-to-action.

- **Elements:**

  - **Hero Image or Avatar:** A professional headshot or a striking visual that makes the section more personal and engaging.

  - **Headline/Title:** A brief, impactful statement about who I am or what I do (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer," "UI/UX Designer").

  - **Introduction Text:** A short paragraph that provides a quick overview of my background, passion, and what I bring to the table.

  - **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:** Prominent buttons that encourage the user to take the next step, such as "View My Work" or "Download Resume."

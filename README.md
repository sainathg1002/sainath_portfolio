### Header Section

The header is the first thing a user sees and acts as the site's primary navigation. It's a crucial component for user experience.

- **Purpose:** To provide site-wide navigation and brand identity.
- **Elements:**
  - **Logo/Name:** My name or a simple logo that serves as the brand identity and, when clicked, returns the user to the `Home` section.
  - **Navigation Links:** A set of links (`Home`, `About`, `Projects`, `Skills`, `Contact`) that allow users to jump to different sections of the website.
  - **Hamburger Menu (Mobile):** On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu icon. Clicking this icon toggles the visibility of the navigation menu, saving screen space and improving usability.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The header is styled to be `position: fixed` or `position: sticky` to remain visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This ensures that navigation is always accessible.
  - CSS Flexbox or Grid is used to align the logo and navigation links horizontally.
  - A media query is used to hide the traditional navigation links and display the hamburger menu icon below a certain screen width (e.g., `max-width: 768px`).

### Home Section

The home section is the main landing page and serves as a digital introduction to who I am.

- **Purpose:** To capture the user's attention, introduce myself, and provide a clear call-to-action.
- **Elements:**
  - **Hero Image or Avatar:** A professional headshot or a striking visual that makes the section more personal and engaging.
  - **Headline/Title:** A brief, impactful statement about who I am or what I do (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer," "UI/UX Designer").
  - **Introduction Text:** A short paragraph that provides a quick overview of my background, passion, and what I bring to the table.
  - **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:** Prominent buttons that encourage the user to take the next step, such as "View My Work" or "Download Resume."

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The content is vertically and horizontally centered to create a clean, balanced look.
  - The background is styled with a gradient or a subtle image to add depth and visual interest.
  - The CTA buttons have hover effects to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction.

### Responsive Web Design

The portfolio is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a great user experience on any device.

- **Purpose:** To make the website accessible and visually appealing on all screen sizes, from a small smartphone to a large desktop monitor.
- **Core Techniques:**
  - **Fluid Layouts:** Using relative units like percentages (`%`) and `vw` (viewport width) instead of fixed pixels (`px`) for element widths. This allows components to scale with the browser window.
  - **Flexible Images and Media:** Images are set with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` to prevent them from overflowing their containers and to maintain their aspect ratio as they scale down.
  - **CSS Media Queries:** This is the cornerstone of responsive design. Media queries apply different CSS rules based on a device's characteristics, such as screen width. For example, a media query for a smaller screen might change a two-column layout into a single-column layout or increase the font size for better readability.
  - **Mobile-First Approach:** Starting the development process by designing and coding for mobile devices first. This ensures the core content is prioritized and the site is performant on smaller devices. After the mobile design is complete, media queries are used to add more complex layouts for tablets and desktops.
